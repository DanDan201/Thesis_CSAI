This is the code repository for my CSAI bachelor thesis 2024.

This study explores the performance of Swin Transformer on the task of brain tumor classification on an MRI dataset. 

The Swin_train_final notebook should be run on a machine with GPU to reduce training time.

The Swin_result notebook can be run on CPU.

The dataset can be found at: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sartajbhuvaji/brain-tumor-classification-mri
